## Rust Systems Chronicle 👋

Welcome. This portfolio is a curated chronicle of my obsession with high-performance, safe systems engineering. My goal is to bridge the gap between academic rigour and industrial excellence.

Here, I document my deep dives into the **Rust ecosystem**:
- **Academic Foundations**: Distilling insights from world-class lectures (like KAIST CS220/431 and MIT 6.824).
- **Seminal Literature**: Reflections on the books and papers that define the modern systems landscape.
- **Industry Trends**: Key takeaways from global conferences like RustConf and EuroRust.

Whether exploring memory safety primitives or the nuances of lock-free concurrency, I aim to maintain the highest standards of technical clarity.
