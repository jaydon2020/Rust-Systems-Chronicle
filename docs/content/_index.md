## Hello, I'm Jian De. 👋

Welcome to my technical portfolio. This site is a living document of my journey through systems programming at **KAIST**. 

Currently, I am deep-diving into **CS220: Programming Principles**, where I'm mastering the foundations of the **Rust** programming language—focusing on memory safety, ownership, and building robust system primitives. 

As I solidify these concepts, I'm preparing for the next challenge: **CS431: Concurrent Programming**, where I'll be applying these skills to high-performance, parallel systems.

Stay tuned as I share my labs, projects, and the occasional "Aha!" moment from the world of low-level code.
