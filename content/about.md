## Hello! I'm a CS220 Student.

### My Interests
- **Systems Programming**: Exploring the low-level details of how software interacts with hardware.
- **Rust**: Building safe and efficient systems.
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and learning from the community.

### About this Portfolio
This site is built with **Zola** and uses the **Serene** theme. It has been customized to showcase my lab work, projects, and technical learnings.
