# Introduction to CS220

This is a placeholder post for the first lab of the CS220 system programming course.

## Rust Code Example

Here is a simple Rust function:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, CS220!");
}
```

## Mathematical Notation

We can also use KaTeX for math:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

And inline math: $ \pi \approx 3.14159 $.
